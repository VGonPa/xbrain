"""Download X-post photos referenced in `Item.media`.

Phase A scope (issue #33): photos only. Videos are deliberately left in the
`MediaVideoPending` variant for a later phase — HLS + ffmpeg is significantly
different complexity and not on the critical path here.

The orchestrator (`download_all`) walks every photo entry on every item,
decides whether it is eligible (pending, transient-failure, or `--force`),
downloads bytes from the X CDN with a cascading size fallback
(``name=orig`` → ``name=large`` → ``name=medium``), validates the bytes with
Pillow, and atomically replaces the entry on the item with the appropriate
variant — `MediaPhotoDownloaded` on success, `MediaPhotoFailed` on a
categorised failure.

Failure categorisation mirrors `xbrain.fetch` (#19): the transient bucket
(`http_5xx`, `timeout`, `unknown_error`) is re-attempted on the next run;
the permanent bucket (`http_4xx`, `format_error`) is only retried with
`--force`. Bare-except is bucketed under `unknown_error` so a future
unhandled error path never silently swallows the URL.

Persistence is the caller's responsibility — the orchestrator mutates
items in place and calls a `save` callback after each photo, so a Ctrl-C
mid-batch leaves `items.json` coherent. The default callback writes the
store atomically via `xbrain.store.save_store`.

I/O dependencies (HTTP session, sleep, Pillow) are dependency-injected via
keyword arguments so tests run offline without monkeypatching.
