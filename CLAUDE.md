# CLAUDE.md — xbrain

Python CLI (`xbrain`) that extracts X bookmarks/tweets into a JSON store and
generates an Obsidian wiki.

## Stack
- Python 3.12+ (venv currently runs 3.13), `uv`, `pydantic` v2, `typer`, `playwright`, `trafilatura`, `pytest`.
- `uv pip install` needs `--index-url https://pypi.org/simple` to bypass the
  machine-wide private FITIZENS pip index.

## Architecture
- Pipeline: `extract → import-archive → fetch → [enrich] → generate`.
- Media side-pipeline: `media` (download photos) → `describe` (vision LLM);
  `refresh-media` re-captures X to backfill the playable video URL + bitrate +
  duration onto already-stored items (video-only, preserves photos/enrichment;
  destructive → auto-snapshot); `download-videos` then downloads the mp4 bytes
  for backfilled videos (mp4 only — HLS `.m3u8` needs ffmpeg and is a deferred
  follow-up; prints a ~GB size-gate, confirm unless `--yes`; destructive →
  auto-snapshot).
- Agent-driven video surface (read/fetch only, ML is external): `list-videos`
  is a **read-only** catalog of video media (`--json` → stable `{id, url, state,
  topic, size_bytes, mp4_url, text}` array; filters `--topic/--status/--max-size/
  --source/--limit`; no writes, no snapshot); `fetch-video --to <dir>` does an
  **ephemeral** mp4 fetch to `<dir>/<id>.mp4` (select by `--ids`/`--topic`),
  reusing `video_media` primitives — deliberately non-persisting: it does NOT
  mutate `items.json`, does NOT snapshot, and does NOT touch `data/media/`.
- `data/items.json` (dict keyed by tweet id) is the source of truth; markdown
  is derived. All stages are idempotent and incremental.
- `enrich` is a stub — the LLM executor is intentionally in pause (spec §9).

## Conventions
- TDD: every module has a `tests/test_*.py`. Run `uv run pytest -v`.
- The X GraphQL parser anchors on key names, not paths — X's private API drifts.
- Never commit personal data: `auth/storage_state.json`, `data/`, `config.toml`.
  All are gitignored.

## Git workflow
- This repo has only `main`: `feature-branch → PR → main`.
